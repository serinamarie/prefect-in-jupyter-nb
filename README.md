Getting Started with Prefect, Jupyter-style!

## Description
We will demo some of the features of Prefect through Jupyter. To begin, open your terminal and run
`pip install notebook`. Once installed, run `jupyter notebook`.

This will start a Python3 kernel.

You will see a variety of files in the repo. Feel free to take a look around if you're interested. To begin the tutorial, open `deployment.ipynb`.
