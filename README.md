# Running your first flow with Prefect, Jupyter-style!

## Getting Started
We will demo some of the features of Prefect through Jupyter. To begin, 
1. Clone the repo with
`git clone git@github.com:serinamarie/prefect-in-jupyter-notebook.git`. 
2. Run `cd prefect-in-jupyter-notebook`.
3. Run `pip install notebook`. 
4. Once installed, run `jupyter notebook`. This will start the notebook server,
where you will see a variety of files. Feel free to take a look around if you're interested. To begin, open `deployment.ipynb`.
